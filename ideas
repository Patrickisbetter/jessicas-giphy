-- a "go to top" button at the end of the main page? if the page is really long scroll

(lets try not to make pages too long, but sounds a nice option for the gif page)



RESOLVED
-- loading screen is the logo/ when you open the website, its a black screen with the logo and then fades into the main page
    (Patrick) - DONE
    
    
IDEAS
-- pop up to login
-- translation button? (part of navbar)
-- separate page for a search and gifs load up below it (with category suggestions or randomizer button?)
-- logo in footer
